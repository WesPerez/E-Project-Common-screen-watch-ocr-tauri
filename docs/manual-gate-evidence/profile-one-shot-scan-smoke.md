Observed result: automated real WebView2/CDP smoke selected only the generated helper app-window source, captured that source as a template, clicked the visible profile scan-once button, observed a positive hit count and log row in the UI, verified the target hit badge/profile hit_count updated, and confirmed alerts.jsonl plus screenshot evidence were written
Evidence files: docs\manual-gate-evidence\logs\webview-visual-smoke-20260707-052803-result.json; docs\manual-gate-evidence\logs\webview-visual-smoke-20260707-052803-app.log; docs\manual-gate-evidence\logs\profile-one-shot-scan-prepared-20260707-052803.png; docs\manual-gate-evidence\logs\profile-one-shot-scan-hit-20260707-052803.png
Cleanup performed: stopped the test-owned app process and helper window process; retained isolated target/webview-visual-smoke run directory and evidence screenshots/logs for audit
Remaining risk: proves the packaged visible one-shot scan path on this Windows interactive desktop with a generated stable window source; it does not prove every third-party window capture implementation or every production image corpus
